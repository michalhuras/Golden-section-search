# Golden-section-search
enviroment: Matlab
Implementation author: Micha≈Ç Huras
This script searches for maximum of defined function in defined boundaries. 
This code is based on one i saw in Polish wikipedia page. https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metoda_z%C5%82otego_podzia%C5%82u
The most important change is that i use 3 points instead of 2 while searching for functions's maximums. Idea comes from classes caled "Modelowanie i Identyfikacj".I have checked this program and didn't find any bugs.
If enyone have any ideas how to make it faster or better in any way or found bugs, please mail me: michal.huras94@gmail.com.
